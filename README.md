## Interesting Read
[The hardest part of building software is not coding, it’s requirements](https://stackoverflow.blog/2023/12/29/the-hardest-part-of-building-software-is-not-coding-its-requirements/)

## Why I found it interesting
I found this article interesting because it shows how gathering, understanding, and managing requirements can make or break a software project. We often people assume coding is the main challenge, but changing requirements lead to miscommunication, wasted work and bugs. I liked how the article discusses that investing time early in defining what needs to be built and keeping stakeholders aligned can be extremely helpful.
