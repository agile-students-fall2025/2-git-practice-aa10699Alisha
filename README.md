## Interesting Read
[The hardest part of building software is not coding, it’s requirements](https://stackoverflow.blog/2023/12/29/the-hardest-part-of-building-software-is-not-coding-its-requirements/)

## Why I found it interesting
I found this article interesting because it shows how gathering, understanding, and managing requirements can make or break a software project. We often people assume coding is the main challenge, but changing requirements lead to miscommunication, wasted work and bugs. I liked how the article discusses that investing time early in defining what needs to be built and keeping stakeholders aligned can be extremely helpful.

## Abyan's comments
I think I mostly agree with what the article is saying, even if the approach is a bit too rigid for me. I feel that AI definitely cannot replace humans right now but the issues described are mostly related to human interaction, and AI can definitely speed up our own processes (and thus smooth over these issues) by coding at a rate faster than humans can, just like it can play Chess better than a human can.
